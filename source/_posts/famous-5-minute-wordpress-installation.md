**Follow the steps given bellow:**

- Download the WordPress Package from WordPress.org and unzip it.
- Create a database for WordPress on your web server, as well as a MySQL user and give all privileges for accessing and modifying it.
- Upload the WordPress files to the desired location on your web server:
- If you want to integrate WordPress into the root of your domain (e.g. `http://example.com/`), move or upload all contents of the unzipped WordPress directory (excluding the WordPress directory itself) into the root directory of your web server.
- If you want to have your WordPress installation in its own subdirectory on your web site (e.g. `http://example.com/blog/`), create the blog directory on your server and upload the contents of the unzipped WordPress package to the directory via FTP.
- Run the WordPress installation script by accessing the URL in a web browser. This should be the URL where you uploaded the WordPress files.
- If you installed WordPress in the root directory, you should visit: http://example.com/
- If you installed WordPress in its own subdirectory called blog, for example, you should visit: `http://example.com/blog/`

Thatâ€™s it success! WordPress is now installed.

Now just go to `http://example.com/wp-admin`  which is the administrator area for your site.
