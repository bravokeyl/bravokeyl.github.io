<section class="card"><h1>About Bravokeyl</h1><div>I'm an independent consultant providing value to small scale businesses and startups using [WordPress](https://bravokeyl.com/wordpress/), [React JS](https://bravokeyl.com/react/), [React Native](https://bravokeyl.com/react-native/) and [AWS](https://bravokeyl.com/aws/). I architect and create custom solutions helping transforming ideas to production with in-depth research involvement.</div></section><section class="card">
<h3 class="section-title">Focused <small>(like a cross-hair)</small> & Honest <small>(like a child)</small></h3><div>Before starting to solve the problem, I try to get a **`focal point`** of that and train my brain and environment to just focus on that, it means when I need to have `apples` today I never look at `oranges` waving at me.

When we work together you can rest assured you have partnered with someone who has knows this particular game. Someone who specializes in a specific field and does it well.</div></section><section class="card"><h3 class="section-title">Quality <small>(humanly possible code)</small></h3><div>I just don't solve problems just by writing some code for machines to interpret, instead I `understand` the client's issue and interpret it in a human way then discuss the solution with them and finally come to a point where writing of code starts which can be `easily` understood by any other future contributor.

I don't believe, the one who writes `complex code` is a better developer, instead I think that developer needs to be educated not to do that.</div></section><section class="card"><h3 class="section-title">Proven success rate <small>(hit me on...)</small></h3><div>I have worked with hundreds of clients (both online and local) over the last 4 years. Over **`47%`** of the projects that I got are either from the `repeated clients` or their `aquaintances`.

That shows, how well I communicate, work and deliver the project while working with the client. They always tell that I'm honest in `budgeting` and `skill level`.</div></section><section class="card"><h3 class="section-title">Pinch me on... <small>(socially available :P for U)</small></h3><div><ul class="social list-inline list-unstyled"><li><a href="https://twitter.com/bravokeyl" title="Twitter" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/bravokeyl" title="Github" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/bravokeyl" title="WordPress" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-wordpress"></i></a></li><li><a href="http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/users/43098/bravokeyl" title="WordPress StackExchange" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-stack-exchange"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bravokeyl" title="Reddit" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT_xdk5b9JFLhQ7n04itLag" title="Youtube" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-youtube"></i></a></li></ul></div>Woah! wait!
